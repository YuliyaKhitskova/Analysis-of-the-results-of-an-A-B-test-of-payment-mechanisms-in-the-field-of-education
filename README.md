Indicators characterizing changes after the implementation of the mechanism were identified.
An analysis was conducted, metrics were linearized, and statistical significance was calculated.
A function has been implemented that automatically loads information from the primary and secondary files and calculates and recalculates metrics based on additional parameters.
A function has been implemented that will plot graphs based on the resulting metrics.
A function has been implemented that linearizes ratio metrics using the Delta method.
